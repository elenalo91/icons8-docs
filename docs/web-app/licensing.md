       <h2> Free of Charge Option </h2>
     </summary>
<p>You are welcome to use icons apps for free for personal or commercial use. In this case, you have to reference us somewhere in an appropriate place of your product. In most cases, it is enough to place a web link pointed to our website's main page. A better option would be to place a link pointed directly to the icon you decided to use. Please note that the free icons can only be downloaded in PNG up to 100x100px. The <a href="https://icons8.com/icon/pack/free-icons/all" rel="nofollow">Popular Icons</a> and <a href="https://icons8.com/icon/pack/Logos/all" rel="nofollow">Logos</a> are free in all formats, including SVG.</p>
